KLets plugin pack
=============

Repository project for new and experimental commands for KLets, translated in Italian and English.

The project and its code is distributed under "GNU General Public License, Version 3" (see LICENSE-GPLv3.txt).


Why there is an open source plugin pack project for KLets?
--------

Commands directly integrated inside KLets are bounded to its release lifecycle, that usually is 2 or 3 month long due to heavy new features addition to its core.

Having a separate project where to add and maintain new and experimental commands allows me to provide faster release dates and bug fixing, regardless KLets development status.

In addition, this open source project allows other developers to contribute for little bugs, new commands and new features addition to existing commands.

Also, it provides a live example on how to write KLets plugins.


Why commands are available only in Italian and English?
--------
In order to provide acceptable delivery times and to remove delays, commands inside this plugin pack will be translated only in languages that I know: Italian (my native language) and English.

Hovewer, everyone can easyly fork this repository in order to maintain and release versions for other languages.
